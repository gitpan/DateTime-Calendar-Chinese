Changes
=======

0.04 30 Jan 2004
  - Was missing the time_zone() method, which makes a difference when
    you pass a DT::C::Chinese to a from_object() method for other
    calendards
  - Add test

0.03 24 Jan 2004
  - It's good to be able to access CVS.
  - Added methods to get the Chinese year name, as well as just the
    celestial stem or the terrestrial branch.  Dave Rolsky.
  - Added a method to return the zodiac animal for the year.  Dave Rolsky.

0.02 24 Jan 2004
[ The "Darn, Astronomical Calendars Are Hard" Release ]
  - Now the time_zone parameter defaults to Asia/Shanghai, so that
    dates by default align with Chinese Calendar
  - Added elapsed_years()
  - Fixed MANIFEST
  - Fixed really nasty bug in the edge case for going from a non-leap
    year to a leap year by requiring DateTime::Event::SolarTerm 0.02,
    which fixes no_major_term_on.
  - Fixed another really nasty bug caused by operator precedence of ? :
  - Fixed _calc_gregorian_components() which was triggered from set()
  - Fixed set() to correctly set the time components
  - Fixed new()'s validation args (missing defaults)
  - Fixed now()
  - Require DateTime::Event::Chinese 0.02

0.01 12 Jan 2004
